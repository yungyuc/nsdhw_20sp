This repository is for collecting homework assignments for
https://github.com/yungyuc/nsd in the semester of 2020 spring.

To turn in your submission, you need to clone this repository, and create a
`pull request (PR) <https://github.com/yungyuc/nsdhw_20sp/pulls>`__.  Your
cloned repository needs to be public on GitHub.  The branch of your PR needs to
be ``<github-user-name>-hw#``, e.g., ``myname-hw2``.

The code in your PR shouldn't duplicate with your classmates'.  Once
duplication is found, the latter submitter should modify the code.  One way to
avoid the hassle is to submit (a correct answer, of course) as early as
possible.
